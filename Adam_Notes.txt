Current Idea - Finance
An app/website that helps you save, as a student, by rewarding you for saving set amounts (nice to have: making it in sync with others, to create a group finance goal). Using the stratagy listed
(https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/my-reward-system-for-savings-helped-me-buy-a-house-2020-4?r=US&IR=T) to give the concept of leveling 
up when you make it to each saving goal, Quests or Achievements for saving certain amounts or saving for prizes of certain amounts. Being able to create
an avatar of yourself to give it a personal look and feel.
